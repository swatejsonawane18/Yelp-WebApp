# Yelp-WebApp

Created a responsive web application that allows you to search for business information using the Yelp API, and the results will be displayed in a card and tabular format. It also allows users to make reservations and see the list of their reservations. Also, users can share a post on Facebook and tweet on Twitter about the business.
